# VR-Crane-Simulator
VR Trainer Simulator (Unity 2022.3.11f1 Prototype)

The project showcases the implementation of two key interactive systems: an overhead crane operated by a remote panel and a handheld gas analyzer for detecting hazardous zones. 

<b> The primary focus was on: </b>
- Building a clean, scalable architecture by decoupling input from game logic using Unity Events;
- Demonstrating proficiency with core Unity concepts and the Vive Input Utility plugin.
